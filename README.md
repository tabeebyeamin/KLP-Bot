# Kijiji Lowest Price Bot
## If you have any suggestions, please let me know!
Submit Issues or let me know however you can. I want to make this project something that people actually want to use so I appreciate all the feedback possible. Tell me what should I add to make it something you would want to use?

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a script through looks through a kijiji web page and finds the
lowest price item with the keyword that you give it.
Uses Python and BS4 and SQLite3 for database entry.
This program works really well with products with easily identifiable model names or numbers, like computer hardware and peripherals, but it will also work on a plethora of other products as shown below. This is how it works right now. I'm always looking to add more features and functionality. If you have any issues or suggestions, please let me know.
